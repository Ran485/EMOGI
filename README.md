# EMOGI: Explainable Multi-Omics Graph Integration
This project predicts cancer genes based on multi-omics feature vectors and protein-protein interactions. Each gene is a data point/node and semi-supervised graph convolutional networks are used for classifying cancer genes.

## Using EMOGI with Existing Models
The models that we used in the paper can be downloaded at: http://owww.molgen.mpg.de/~sasse/EMOGI/.
Those models can be used to compute LRP contributions and plots like performance comparisons can be done using the postprocessing script in the EMOGI directory.

## Computing Contributions for Genes of Interest
A trained EMOGI model can be interrogated in a gene-wise fashion to find out why the algorithm considered a gene a cancer gene or not.
To compute the feature and interaction partner contributions for a gene of interest, use:
```
python lrp.py -m <path-to-model-directory> -g <hugo-symbol1> <hugo-symbol2> -b True/False
```
The genes have to be provided as hugo gene symbols, eg. `EGFR` or `BRCA1`. The `-b` option controls if the resulting plots are heatmaps (more compact, as shown in the paper) or more informative barplots whose error bars indicate standard deviation across cross-validation runs.
Finally, to compute the contributions for all genes (~13,000 to 15,000 depending on the PPI network used), you can specify the `-a` option. This will take a long time, however, and uses all available cores.

*Note: The LRP script is often better not executed on GPU because it doesn't benefit from it and uses a lot of space.*

## Training EMOGI with Your Own Data
To train EMOGI with your own data, you have to provide a [HDF5](https://www.h5py.org/) container containing the graph, features and labels. There are scripts in `pancancer/preprocessing` that help with the contruction of the container. In general, a valid container for EMOGI has to contain a graph (called `network`, a numpy matrix of shape N x N), a feature matrix for the nodes (called `features`, of shape N x p), the gene names and IDs (called `gene_names`, as numpy array, dtype `object`), the training set (called `á»³_train`, as boolean indicator array of shape N x 1), the test set of the same shape (called `y_test`), training and test masks (called `train_mask` and `test_mask`, again, indicator arrays of shape N x 1) and the names of the features (called `feature_names`, an array of length p). Optionally, the raw features can also be added to aid biological interpretation when analyzing the LRP plots (called `features_raw`, the first row plots the input features and it might be better to plot unnormalized values).

Once you obtained a valid HDF5 container, you can simply train EMOGI with
```
python train_cv.py -d <path-to-hdf5-container> -hd <n_filters_layer1> <n_filters_layer2>
```
where the `-hd` argument specifies the number of graph convolutional layers (the number of arguments) and the number of filters per layer. Training with `-hd 100 50` for instance implies that EMOGI is trained with 2 graph convolutional layers with 100 and 50 filters.

## Preparing Your Own Data for Use with EMOGI
See the [readme file in pancancer](pancancer/README.md) for explanations on how you can process your own data and prepare it for EMOGI training.


## Dependencies
To run EMOGI, the following packages are required:
* gcn (https://github.com/tkipf/gcn)
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Tensorflow
* h5py
* Networkx
* deepExplain (for an implementation of LRP, https://github.com/marcoancona/DeepExplain)
* mygene (for mapping of gene IDs)

For plotting and correct functioning of all the notebooks, you additionally might need:
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn
* Scipy
* Goatools (for pathway enrichment)
* UMAP (for dimension reduction)

## Additional datasets
We used various different data sets from the community to train and validate EMOGI. For deriving positive and negative labels, as well as for functional validation and relationships to other cancer gene sets, a diverse set of data sets were used. Links to the databases and publications can be found below. Ideally, the jupyter notebooks in this repository contain a data section in the beginning where you can exchange the paths with your own copies of the files. Furthermore, some crucial scripts (such as postprocessing and computation of LRP) will work but not produce all of the plots if certain datasets are not available.
